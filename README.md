# Project: Monster Shop

Monster Shop is a fictitious e-commerce application that has admins, merchants, registered users, and visitors. Our application allows admins to manage all users. Merchants can fulfill orders, change order status and enable/disable items. Registered users and visitors can browse the items, place items in their shopping cart and checkout. Customers of the site can register and log in.

### Objective and Implementation
